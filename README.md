# Zeckendorf_Learning_Model
In 2018, Baird-Smith et al. (arXiv:1809.04881) created the "Zeckendorf Game." They provided a non-constructive (strategy-stealing) proof that Player 2 always has a winning strategy. We build a reinforcement learning model for this game, in an effort to construct such a general winning strategy.
